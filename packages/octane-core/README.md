# OCTANE INTERNAL FORK

This is a fork of the old Octane project by Solana (now Anza)

https://github.com/anza-xyz/octane

This repository recreates the "core" package from the Octane project in a simplified way, excluding functionality which isn't needed. The only required feature for the BlastTools frontend is the gasless swap feature.
